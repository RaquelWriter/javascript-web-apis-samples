# About The WEB APIS SAMPLES WITH JAVASCRIPT

This is a sample code for showing the consuming web apis (battery status API and localStorage) with Vanilla Javascript.

### Built With

Javascript, HTML5, CSS.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Download the zip and unzip.

There are two folders. Open the index.html of each project in your browser.

## battery-status folder

With this project you can check the battery status of your computer, using only the Battery Status Web Api from navigation method of the browser.

Sample code:

```javascript
let batteryIsCharging = false;

navigator.getBattery().then((battery) => {
  batteryIsCharging = battery.charging;

  battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', () => {
    batteryIsCharging = battery.charging;
  });
});
```

## localstorage folder

The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.

Sample code:

```javascript
let todos;
if (localStorage.getItem('todos') === null) {
  todos = [];
} else {
  todos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todos'));
}
```

Get item from the storage:

```javascript
localStorage.getItem('todos');
```

Set item (add data to the local storage):

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('todos', 'Go to gym');
```

Remove item:

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('todos');
```

Remove all localStorage:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```

## fetch-api folder

Fetch demo in vanilla JS to fetch the data from [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) of fake blogs.
You can use also another APIs like [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/).

The details of the position can be fetched from a positionstack API: [Position Stack API](https://positionstack.com/). For this project, there is no request to this API. The sample code for that could be:

```javascript
const getInfoGeolocation = async (lat, long) => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `http://api.positionstack.com/v1/reverse/?access_key=------------&query=${lat},${long}`
    );
    const data = await res.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```
